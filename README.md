# CI-Upgrader

The CI-Upgrader will help you to upgrade your CodeIgniter 3 project to CodeIgniter 4.

To do this, these tasks are carried out automatically:

- Installation
- Copy Files
- Edit Files (with kenjishelper)
- Create UpgradeLog

**But** the CI-Upgrader is **not** able to transfer all your code to the new CodeIgniter 4 project.
Thats because CodeIgniter 3 projects can be very individual, specially own created Libraries, Classes and Functions. 

For more informations about the CI-Upgrader and the adjustment that have to be done after the upgrade, check out the [Documentation](https://github.com/FlorianNelles/CI-Upgrader/blob/main/Documentation.md).
